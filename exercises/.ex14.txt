Allowed functions: malloc

Create a function that takes a pointer to an array of integers and its size.
Create a copy of it, that only includes entries that are prime numbers.
The last entry in the copy should be '\0'. Return the pointer to the copy.
If an error occurs return NULL.

In addition, write a second function that takes a pointer to an array of integers and its size,
and rearranges the array in-place so that all prime numbers come before all non-prime numbers.
The order of the prime numbers and the order of the non-prime numbers should be the same as in the original array.

Function Prototypes:
int *copy_primes(int *arr, int size);
void rearrange_primes(int *arr, int size);

Notes:
- You will need to write a helper function to check if a number is prime.
- Be careful with memory allocation in the 'copy_primes' function. You won't know how many primes there are until you check each number, so you may need to reallocate memory as you find each prime.
- The 'rearrange_primes' function should not create a new array. It should rearrange the numbers in the existing array.
