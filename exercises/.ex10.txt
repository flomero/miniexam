Create a function that takes a pointer to an array of integers and its size.
Create a copy of it, that only includes every even entry starting at 0,
that can be freed. The last entry in copy should be '0'. Return the pointer
to the copy. If an error occurs return NULL.

You can assume that that the initial array does not include a 0.

int	*copy_even(int *arr, int size);
