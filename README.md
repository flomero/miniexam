# Piscine 101

## General Tips

* Do they ask for a *program*? -> **include main function**
* Do they ask for a *function*? -> **no main**
* Is the task to **recreate a function**?
	* always use and read the manual `man functionname`
	* import and use the original function and compare the output to your solution (of course dont submit it)
* If you fail a submition don't give up. Take a look at the `traces` folder. The newest file in there will give you helpfull information about your mistake. (examshell will tell you were to find it)
* **alwys** test your code before submitting
	* write a main that uses and tests your solution
	* try to check for edge cases  
	(eg `0`, `INT_MIN` and `INT_MAX` if you are working with integers)
